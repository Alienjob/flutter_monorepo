# Repository Reorganization Demo Project

This project demonstrates the reorganization of a large monolithic repository into a more manageable structure. The project simulates a real-world scenario where a large codebase needs to be restructured for better maintainability and scalability.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
repo/
├── app1/                    # First application build configuration
├── app2/                    # Second application build configuration
└── components/             # Shared components and modules
    ├── app1_module/        # Business logic for app1
    ├── app2_module/        # Business logic for app2
    ├── component1/         # Shared component 1
    ├── component2/         # Shared component 2
    ├── module1/           # Shared module 1
    └── module2/           # Shared module 2
```

## Architecture Overview

The repository follows a hierarchical dependency structure:

1. **Applications (app1, app2)**
   - Contain build configurations
   - Can include functionality from their respective modules
   - Depend on components and modules

2. **Business Logic Modules (app1_module, app2_module)**
   - Contain core business logic for respective applications
   - Located in the components directory for better reusability
   - App1 can include parts of app2 functionality through module dependencies

3. **Components and Modules**
   - Components depend on modules
   - Both are shared resources that can be used across applications
   - Promotes code reuse and maintainability

## Purpose

This demo project illustrates:
1. Clear separation between build configuration and business logic
2. Modular architecture with well-defined dependencies
3. Shared component and module management
4. Best practices for organizing large codebases
5. Version control strategies for monorepo management

## Goals

- Demonstrate clear separation between build configuration and business logic
- Show how shared components and modules can be managed within a monorepo structure
- Provide examples of dependency management in a hierarchical structure
- Support flexible integration of functionality between applications (e.g., app1 using app2 features)
- Enable efficient code sharing and reuse through the components directory

## Development Workflow

The repository structure supports a workflow where:
- Applications (app1, app2) focus on build and deployment configuration
- Business logic is developed in respective modules (app1_module, app2_module)
- Shared functionality is developed in components and modules
- Dependencies flow from apps → components → modules
